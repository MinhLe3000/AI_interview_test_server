How would you write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers who have spent the most money in the last quarter, along with their total spending?",
            "response": "Sure. To find the top 5 customers who spent the most in the last quarter, I would write a query that:\n\nFilters orders from the last quarter,\n\nGroups them by customer_id,\n\nSums the total_amount,\n\nSorts the result in descending order, and\n\nLimits the output to 5 rows.\n\nFor example, in Oracle SQL, it would look like this:\n\nSELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent\nFROM customer_orders\nWHERE order_date >= ADD_MONTHS(TRUNC(SYSDATE, 'Q'), -3)\nGROUP BY customer_id\nORDER BY total_spent DESC\nFETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;"
